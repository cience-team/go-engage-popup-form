# Go Engage Popup Form Integration

This project allows you to easily integrate a popup form into your Go Engage-powered website. The popup form displays on the page, and users can interact with it to submit their information. The provided `script.js` and `style.css` files handle the popup's functionality and appearance.

## How to Use

To use this project and integrate the Go Engage popup form on your website, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Include the Styles

Add the following code to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<!-- Popup Form Styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cience-team.github.io/go-engage-popup-form/dist/styles.min.css">
<style>
    /* Custom styles for the Go Engage form button */
    .mauticform-button {
        background: #3076FF !important;
        border: 2px solid #3076FF !important;
    }
    .mauticform-button:hover {
        background: transparent !important;
    }
</style>
<!-- -->
```

### Step 2: Add the Popup Container

Add the following HTML code to your webpage:

```html
<div id="popupContainer">
    <span class="closeButton" onclick="closePopup()" title="Close">Ã—</span>
    {form=1}
</div>
```

The `{form=1}` will be replaced with the actual Go Engage form.

> **Note:** Replace the number '1' in {form=1} with the actual ID of your Go Engage form. You can find the form ID on the Forms page in Go Engage. 

### Step 3: Include the Scripts

Add the following code at the end of the `<body>` section of your HTML document, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- Popup Form Scripts -->
<script src="https://cience-team.github.io/go-engage-popup-form/dist/script.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 4: Customize (Optional)

You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the popup form by modifying the `style.css` and `script.js` files as needed. Remember to re-minify the files using Gulp after making changes.

```bash
# Install the required dependencies
npm install

# Run the Gulp task to minify the files
gulp
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the Go Engage popup form into your website. Visitors will now see the popup form when they click on elements with the class `.cta`. The form submission data will be sent to Go Engage for further processing.
